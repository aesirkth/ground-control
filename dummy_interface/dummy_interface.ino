/*
This code is a demo of how the data transmission works between the Ground Station Computer and the Rocket systems:

    Telemetry is received in real time from the Rocket on the Ground Station Computer via a downlink telemetry transmitter
    This link is unidirectional
    
    Commands are sent from the Ground Station to the Launch Pad Station
    This link is bidirectional

In the real world:
    - The Rocket and the Ground Station Computer are connected through a telemetry transmitter and a telemetry receiver
    - The Launch Pad Station and the Ground Station Computer are connected through two wireless tranceivers

On the Ground Station Computer side, two Arduino boards are used as a gateways to the wireless tranceiver (from the LPS)
and to the wireless receiver (from the Rocket). The Arduino boards are connected to the computer via USB for power 
supply and serial link transmission

This code simulates a gateway to the Rocket or to the Launch Pad System and feeds fake data to the Ground Station Computer
to be used for development/testing purposes
